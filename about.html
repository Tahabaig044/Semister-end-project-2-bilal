    <h1>ABOUT SEC</h1>
    <h2>DR ABDUS SALAM</h2>
    <p>Dr. Abdus Salam (January 29, 1926 – November 21, 1996) was a pioneering Pakistani physicist known for his work in theoretical physics. He shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics with Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg for their contributions to the electroweak unification theory, which combines the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces. Dr. Salam was the first Pakistani and first Muslim scientist to win a Nobel Prize in science. He also founded the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) to support scientists from developing countries. His legacy continues in both scientific research and global scientific collaboration.</p>

        <h3>BIOGRAPHY</h3>
        <p data-aos="fade-left">Dr. Abdus Salam (1926–1996) was a Pakistani theoretical physicist who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for his work on the electroweak unification theory, which combined the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces. Born in Jhang, Pakistan, he studied at Cambridge University and later contributed significantly to the development of the Standard Model of particle physics. Salam was also a strong advocate for scientific development in the developing world, founding the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Italy. Despite facing political challenges in Pakistan due to his Ahmadiyya Muslim faith, his scientific legacy endures globally.</p>

        <h3>ACHIVEMENTS</h3>
        <p data-aos="fade-right">Dr. Abdus Salam’s achievements are monumental in physics and global science advocacy. He won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics for his electroweak unification theory, crucial to the Standard Model of particle physics. Salam founded the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Italy to support scientists in developing nations. His work on quantum field theory and contributions like the Pati-Salam model advanced theoretical physics. Beyond research, he was a lifelong advocate for science in the developing world, inspiring countless young scientists. His legacy as a brilliant physicist and humanitarian remains influential globally. </p>
